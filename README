-----SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS-----

The ConstantDipole plugin has been tested with:

 - HOOMD 2.9.7, compiled in single-precision with CUDA
 - CUDA 11.3
 - Python 3.9.7

The HOOMD installation must have GPU acceleration enabled and HOOMD must be compiled as a shared library for
plugins to be built against it. HOOMD must be compiled in single-precision mode.

-----COMPILING THE PLUGIN-----

To compile this plugin, follow steps similar to those in compiling HOOMD-Blue.  Note that plugins can only be built
against a hoomd build that has been installed via a package or compiled and then installed via 'make install'.
Plugins can only be built against hoomd when it is built as a shared library.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j6
$ make install

By default, make install will install the plugin into
/{hoomd-install}/hoomd/ConstantDipole
where {hoomd-install} is the directory that hoomd was 'make install'ed into.
The plugin can be imported into python as a module with
import hoomd.ConstantDipole
